# OOP-Java-UCSD-Coursera-solutions

This repository contains solutions for the Coursera course "Object Oriented Programming in Java" offered by the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). The course focuses on developing Java programming skills and applying object-oriented design principles to create interactive applications with 2D graphics and GUIs.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into the following modules:

1. **Module 1: Introduction to Java Programming**
   - Basic syntax and concepts
   - Primitive data types and operators
   - Control structures

2. **Module 2: Object-Oriented Programming**
   - Classes and objects
   - Encapsulation and data hiding
   - Inheritance and polymorphism

3. **Module 3: Data Structures and Algorithms**
   - Arrays and ArrayLists
   - LinkedLists, Stacks, and Queues
   - Searching and sorting algorithms

4. **Module 4: 2D Graphics and GUIs**
   - Introduction to 2D graphics
   - Event-driven programming
   - Building interactive GUIs

5. **Module 5: Final Project - Earthquake Map**
   - Integrating all learned concepts
   - Developing an interactive map to visualize earthquake data
   - Using third-party libraries and APIs
